Visit the website here: https://guil913.github.io/assignment2/ 


2. DESCRIPTION:

  -The website is designed to showcase poems from the Book series "Guess How Much I Love You", capturing the heartfelt connection
  between Nutbrown and Little Nutbrown Hare. It offers an interactive seasonal experience, allowing users to switch between themes
  that match the mood of the poems. The goal is to honor and revive a childhood classic by making a website that gives the same 
  vibes as the books, following their themes like the daily poems for each month, and the 4 seasons with their respective poems.



3. FEATURES:

  3.1 A "What is this?" button that opens a pop-up with general information about the website, providing context for all users.

  3.2 A "Swap" button that allows users to cycle between four themes, each corresponding to a different season. The current season is displayed at the top left. These themes change the background and overall color scheme of the layout.

  3.3 A "Calendar" button that opens a pop-up with 31 buttons, each linked to a poem for that specific day. Clicking on a button takes you to the respective poem.

  3.4 A "Get Random Quote" button that fetches and displays a random quote each time it is clicked, using the Advice Slip API (https://api.adviceslip.com/advice). This feature is designed to inspire users to write their own poems.

  3.5 Various CSS animations enhance the user experience. These include button scaling, color transitions for the background, image and logo rotations, stretching text effects for quotes and authors, and floating animations, among others.

  3.6 The website is fully responsive, adapting to different screen resolutions and devices through media queries.
