            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown Hare, who was going to bed,
                held on tight to Big Nutbrown Hare’s very
                long ears. He wanted to be sure that Big
                Nutbrown Hare was listening.
                “Guess how much I love you,” he said.
                “Oh, I don’t think I could guess that,” said Big
                Nutbrown Hare.
                “This much,” said Little Nutbrown Hare,
                stretching out his arms as wide as they could
                go.
                Big Nutbrown Hare had even longer arms.
                “But I love YOU this much,” he said.
                Hmm, that is a lot, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. </p>
            <p class="poem">“I love you as high as I can reach.” said Little
                Nutbrown Hare.
                “I love you as high as I can reach,” said Big
                Nutbrown Hare.
                That is quite high, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. I wish I had arms like that.
                Then Little Nutbrown Hare had a good idea.
                He tumbled upside down and reached up the
                tree trunk with his feet.
                “I love you all the way up to my toes!” he said.
                “And I love you all the way up to your toes,”
                said Big Nutbrown Hare, swinging him up
                over his head. </p>
            <p class="poem">“But I love you as high as I can hop,” smiled
                Big Nutbrown Hare - and he hopped so high
                that his ears touched the branches above.
                That’s good hopping, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. I wish I could hop like that.
                “I love you all the way down the lane as far as
                the river,” cried Little Nutbrown Hare.
                “I love you across the river and over the hills,”
                said Big Nutbrown Hare.
                That’s very far, thought Little Nutbrown Hare.
                He was almost too sleepy to think any more.
                Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes, out
                into the big dark night.</p>
            <p class="poem">Nothing could be further than the sky.
                “I love you right up to the MOON,” he said,
                and closed his eyes.
                “Oh, that’s far,” said Big Nutbrown Hare. “That
                is very, very far.”
                Big Nutbrown Hare settled Little Nutbrown
                Hare into his bed of leaves. He leaned over
                and kissed him good night.
                Then he lay down close by and whispered
                with a smile, “I love you right up to the moon
                AND BACK.”</p>
            <p class="poem">Guess how much I love you.
                No, it isn’t as much as the glimmering stars above.
                Nor even half the size of the vast ocean.
                It doesn’t even amount to the numerous grains of sand.
                Guess how much I love you.
                It can’t be tantamount to the reach of light.
                Never as deep as the darkest trench of the sea.
                The warmth of fire is not even justifiable.</p>
             <p class="poem">Guess how much I love you.
                It’s nothing like the comforting love of a mother,
                Nor the embracing care of the father,
                Even the camaraderie of siblings isn’t comparable.</p>   
            <p class="poem">Let me tell you just how much I love you.
                My love for you can’t surmount to any one thing
                For there be naught to measure how much I care for you.
                The love inside me, your love,
                Breathes greater than any measure of reality.
                Such pure care, so deep understanding, everlasting safety,
                This my soul speaks. This my love is.</p> 
            <p class="poem">
                In a lush meadow surrounded by swaying grasses and delicate wildflowers, two furry hares named Nutbrown and Little Nutbrown shared a special bond. Nutbrown, the older and wiser of the two, loved his energetic companion, Little Nutbrown, very much. Together, they went on adventures as big as the sky itself.
            </p> 
            <p class="poem">One sunny morning, as the warm sun filled the meadow, Little Nutbrown turned to Nutbrown with a sparkle in his eye. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked, excited and curious. Nutbrown smiled at Little Nutbrown, his eyes shining with love. “Oh, I don’t know,” he replied kindly. “How much do you love me?”</p> 
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown stretched his arms wide, his tiny paws reaching as far as they could. “I love you all the way to the tip of my toes!” he exclaimed earnestly. Nutbrown chuckled softly, feeling warm inside. He stretched his own arms wide, his paws reaching out to meet Little Nutbrown’s. “Well, I love you all the way to the tip of your toes and back,” he said, promising his love.</p> 
            <p class="poem">One evening, as the sun set and painted the world in pink and orange, Little Nutbrown looked up at Nutbrown thoughtfully. “Guess how much I love you,” he whispered softly. Nutbrown looked at Little Nutbrown, his eyes full of love. “I’m not sure,” he replied gently. “How much do you love me?”</p> 
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown snuggled close to Nutbrown, his heart beating with his friend’s. “I love you as far as the river goes and as high as the mountains touch the sky,” he said, his words as deep as a thousand sunsets.</p> 
            <p class="poem">Nutbrown smiled at Little Nutbrown, his heart full of love as vast as the universe. He hugged his friend close. “I love you as far as the river goes and as high as the mountains touch the sky,” he whispered, promising his love forever.</p> 
            <p class="poem">And so, in the meadow where wildflowers swayed and the sun and moon shared their gentle light, Nutbrown and Little Nutbrown learned that love didn’t need words. It was a bond that went beyond the world’s limits, a connection felt in every heartbeat and glance shared.</p> 
            <p class="poem">One bright afternoon, as a gentle breeze whispered through the trees, Little Nutbrown gazed up at Nutbrown with wonder. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked with a hopeful smile. Nutbrown's eyes softened as he looked down. “How much, my little one?” he replied, filled with warmth.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown stretched his tiny paws as far as he could, standing on tiptoes. “I love you as high as I can reach,” he declared proudly. Nutbrown chuckled, reaching his own arms to the sky. “Well, I love you as high as the clouds above and even higher,” he replied with a gentle laugh.</p>
            <p class="poem">In the glow of the twilight, with stars beginning to twinkle, Little Nutbrown nestled close to Nutbrown’s side. “Guess how much I love you,” he whispered, his voice as soft as the evening breeze. Nutbrown turned, his gaze tender. “How much, dear one?” he asked quietly.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown pointed up to the moon, shining bright. “I love you to the moon and back, and then even further.” Nutbrown smiled, holding him close. “Then I love you all the way past the stars, to wherever love can go,” he promised softly.</p>
            <p class="poem">On a quiet morning, as mist rose gently from the meadow, Little Nutbrown looked up at Nutbrown, eyes twinkling with a question. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked shyly. Nutbrown leaned down, his voice full of kindness. “Tell me, my dear,” he replied.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown pointed to the hills stretching far away. “I love you as far as those hills, and then as far as my heart can imagine.” Nutbrown held him close, whispering, “And I love you as wide as all the lands, and as deep as forever.”</p>
            <p class="poem">As night fell softly, Little Nutbrown nestled into Nutbrown’s arms, listening to the soft sounds of the world winding down. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked sleepily. Nutbrown’s heart warmed as he looked at him. “How much, my little one?” he asked with a smile.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown reached out his tiny hand, as far as it would go. “I love you to the edge of the world,” he whispered, his eyes closing. Nutbrown kissed his forehead. “Then I love you beyond it, to where dreams are born,” he murmured, holding him close.</p>
            <p class="poem">In the morning light, with dewdrops glistening on the grass, Little Nutbrown took a deep breath, smiling up at Nutbrown. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked, his voice full of joy. Nutbrown smiled back. “Tell me, little one,” he answered gently.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown stretched his arms wide. “I love you as far as the sky is blue, and as deep as the ocean.” Nutbrown wrapped his arms around him, saying, “And I love you as endless as the sky and as deep as the stars in the night.”</p>
            <p class="poem">One rainy evening, as the rain tapped gently on the leaves, Little Nutbrown looked up at Nutbrown with bright eyes. “Guess how much I love you,” he said, his voice full of wonder. Nutbrown smiled and leaned closer. “How much, my dear one?” he asked softly.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown pointed to the rainbow stretching across the sky. “I love you all the colors of that rainbow.” Nutbrown held him close, whispering, “And I love you in every color, every moment, for always.”</p>
            <p class="poem">One crisp morning, as the sun rose over the hills, Little Nutbrown looked up at Nutbrown with a bright smile. “Guess how much I love you?” he asked eagerly. Nutbrown knelt down, his eyes filled with warmth. “How much, my little one?” he asked softly.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown spread his arms as wide as he could. “I love you as big as the whole world!” he declared proudly. Nutbrown hugged him tight, saying, “And I love you as big as the whole world, and every moment in it.”</p>
            <p class="poem">One golden evening, with fireflies dancing around them, Little Nutbrown gazed at Nutbrown, his eyes full of wonder. “Guess how much I love you,” he whispered. Nutbrown looked at him with a gentle smile. “How much, little one?” he asked tenderly.</p>
            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown stretched up on his toes, reaching for the stars. “I love you to the stars and back.” Nutbrown held him close, replying, “Then I love you to all the stars and beyond, forever and always.”</p>
            <p class="poem">I want you to believe how
                I love you. So truly, without a doubt
                Trust this feeling I have. Know this dear,
                Your value to me, so precious you are.
                Undeniable. Irreplaceable in this life you are
                Such is the way in which
                I love you.</p>

                <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
                <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
