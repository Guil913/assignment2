<h1>GUESS HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU</h1>

            <p class="poem">Little Nutbrown Hare, who was going to bed,
                held on tight to Big Nutbrown Hare’s very
                long ears. He wanted to be sure that Big
                Nutbrown Hare was listening.
                “Guess how much I love you,” he said.
                “Oh, I don’t think I could guess that,” said Big
                Nutbrown Hare.
                “This much,” said Little Nutbrown Hare,
                stretching out his arms as wide as they could
                go.
                Big Nutbrown Hare had even longer arms.
                “But I love YOU this much,” he said.
                Hmm, that is a lot, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. </p>
            <p class="poem">“I love you as high as I can reach.” said Little
                Nutbrown Hare.
                “I love you as high as I can reach,” said Big
                Nutbrown Hare.
                That is quite high, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. I wish I had arms like that.
                Then Little Nutbrown Hare had a good idea.
                He tumbled upside down and reached up the
                tree trunk with his feet.
                “I love you all the way up to my toes!” he said.
                “And I love you all the way up to your toes,”
                said Big Nutbrown Hare, swinging him up
                over his head. </p>
            <p class="poem">“But I love you as high as I can hop,” smiled
                Big Nutbrown Hare - and he hopped so high
                that his ears touched the branches above.
                That’s good hopping, thought Little Nutbrown
                Hare. I wish I could hop like that.
                “I love you all the way down the lane as far as
                the river,” cried Little Nutbrown Hare.
                “I love you across the river and over the hills,”
                said Big Nutbrown Hare.
                That’s very far, thought Little Nutbrown Hare.
                He was almost too sleepy to think any more.
                Then he looked beyond the thorn bushes, out
                into the big dark night.</p>
            <p class="poem">Nothing could be further than the sky.
                “I love you right up to the MOON,” he said,
                and closed his eyes.
                “Oh, that’s far,” said Big Nutbrown Hare. “That
                is very, very far.”
                Big Nutbrown Hare settled Little Nutbrown
                Hare into his bed of leaves. He leaned over
                and kissed him good night.
                Then he lay down close by and whispered
                with a smile, “I love you right up to the moon
                AND BACK.”</p>
